What do I charge for my tuition?

### I travel by bicycle, so I ask for a **£5** callout if it will take me longer than 30minutes to get to you.  
------------------------------
### A-LEVEL (Equiv.)
#### - £30 per hour
------------------------------
### GCSE (Equiv.)
#### - £30 per hour
------------------------------
### Pre-GCSE 
#### - £25 per hour
------------------------------
### Group Discounts
#### - 2 Tutees: £5ph off each
#### - 3 or more: £10ph off each
An example: 3 student group doing A-level, Total cost = £60 for the group (£20 per tutee). 

I hope this is fair. I offer the best possible service I can and I am open to feedback. It's my goal to improve constantly, aligned with the Japenese phiolosphy of Kaizen, it's all small continuous improvements to be excellent. 

I reserve the right to change these fees. However, I will always give due notice for this if it occurs.
