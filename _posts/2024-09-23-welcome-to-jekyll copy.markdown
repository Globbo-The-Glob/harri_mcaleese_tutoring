What experience do I have teaching?

I basically live and breathe what I teach. I have spent the last 3.5 years working on a PhD in Soft Robotics at the University of Manchester. I also do hobbyist research in theoretical biophysics and computing, that involves a lot of coding and mathematics. Staying up to date on science is something I'd do regardless and I am constantly reading textbooks and state of the art research papers. 

During my PhD, I have also taught undergraduates topics like fluid mechanics, maths, classical mechanics, experimental coding and data acquistion. In that time I found a real love for teaching, leading classes and explaining tough concepts to people. I also found my passion helped bring people up who found things challenging, and I made sure to speak to those people directly and try help them come out of their shell. I receieved wonderful feedback from students that made me proud of the work I'd done. 
I also volunteered during my A-Levels to teach Year 7 students who had difficulty with basic maths. This was challeging, as the kids assigned to me had behavioural problems, but after a few weeks I feel we had made a connection and they started to improve.
